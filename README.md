# Stack Implementation in C

This C program demonstrates a basic implementation of a stack data structure using an array. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Features

- Initialize an empty stack.
- Push an element onto the stack.
- Pop an element from the stack.
- Peek at the top element without removing it.
- Check if the stack is empty.
- Check if the stack is full (based on a maximum capacity).

## Code Structure

- `main.c`: The main program that demonstrates the stack implementation.
- `stack.h`: Header file defining the stack structure and function prototypes.
- `stack.c`: Source file containing the stack implementation functions.
